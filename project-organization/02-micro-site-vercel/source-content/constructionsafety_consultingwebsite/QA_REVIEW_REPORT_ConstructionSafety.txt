❌ ISSUES REQUIRING CORRECTION:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ISSUE #1: META DESCRIPTIONS TOO LONG (CRITICAL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Google truncates meta descriptions at 155-160 characters.
Ours exceed this limit and will be cut off in search results.

CURRENT META DESCRIPTIONS:

Homepage: 208 characters ✗ TOO LONG
"Expert construction safety consulting services for federal and California 
projects. SDVOSB/DVBE certified. SSHO services, safety representatives, 
EM 385-1-1 compliance. Based in San Diego, serving nationwide."

nationwide."

Safety Representatives: 163 characters ✗ TOO LONG

oversight, Cal-OSHA compliance, daily inspections, training. California &

CORRECTED META DESCRIPTIONS (All ≤ 160 characters):

Homepage: 157 characters ✓

EM 385-1-1 compliance. Federal & California projects. San Diego-based."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ISSUE #2: PAGE TITLES TOO LONG (MODERATE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Google truncates page titles at 60 characters in search results.
Two of our titles exceed this and will be cut off.

CURRENT PAGE TITLES:

Homepage: 82 characters ✗ TOO LONG
"Construction Safety Consulting | SDVOSB & DVBE Certified | California & Nationwide"

SSHO Services: 51 characters ✓ GOOD
"SSHO Services | Site Safety Health Officer | SDVOSB"
