          "text": "Frequently Asked Questions About SSHO Services Q1: What is an SSHO? A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) is a qualified safety professional who serves as the contractor's primary safety representative on federal construction projects. The SSHO ensures compliance with EM 385-1-1 safety requirements, conducts daily inspections, develops safety plans, provides worker training, and serves as the main point of contact for government safety inspectors. Q2: When is an SSHO required? USACE, NAVFAC, and most federal construction contracts require a dedicated SSHO when the contract value exceeds $5 million or when the contracting officer determines project hazards warrant it. Review your contract's Section 01 35 26 for specific SSHO requirements. Q3: What qualifications does your SSHO staff have? Our SSHO team includes Certified Industrial Hygienists (CIH), Certified Safety Professionals (CSP), and Construction Health and Safety Technicians (CHST). All staff have 30-Hour OSHA Construction Safety certification, EM 385-1-1 training, and extensive experience on federal military construction projects. Q4: How does working with an SDVOSB help my company? As a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, we help prime contractors meet their small business subcontracting goals on federal projects. Subcontracting with us counts toward your SDVOSB participation requirements, helping you maintain compliance and improve your past performance record for future federal opportunities. Q5: What's your geographic coverage? We're based in San Diego and primarily serve California military installations, but we provide SSHO services nationwide for federal construction projects. Contact us to discuss your project location. Q6: How quickly can you mobilize an SSHO? We maintain a team of ready SSHO professionals and can typically mobilize within 1-2 weeks of contract award, depending on base access clearance timelines.
