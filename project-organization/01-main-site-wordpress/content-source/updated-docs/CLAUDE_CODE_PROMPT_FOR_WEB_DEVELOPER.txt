FOLLOW-UP PROMPTS YOUR WEB DEVELOPER CAN USE:

After the initial response, use these prompts for specific tasks:

"Create the responsive CSS for the SSHO page with mobile-first approach"

"Add the JSON-LD structured data for LocalBusiness and Service schemas"

"Create the navigation menu with the 4 new service links in the correct positions"

"Optimize all images for web (WebP format, lazy loading, proper dimensions)"

"Create the FAQ section with accessible accordion functionality"

"Add the contact form with validation and submission handling"

"Generate the complete meta tags including Open Graph for social sharing"

"Create a staging checklist for testing before going live"

"Show me how to implement the internal linking between the new pages"

"Create responsive CSS Grid layouts for the 3-column benefit sections"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TIPS FOR WORKING WITH CLAUDE CODE:

1. BE SPECIFIC: The more context you provide, the better the output
   - Good: "Create a responsive hero section with navy blue background, white text, and two CTA buttons"
   - Bad: "Make a hero section"

2. ITERATE: Start with structure, then refine
   - First: Get the HTML structure right
   - Then: Add CSS styling
   - Finally: Add interactivity and optimization

3. REFERENCE FILES: Tell Claude Code which file to read
   - "Read the file 1_Web_Designer_Instructions_Part1_SSHO.json"
   - "Extract the hero section content from the SSHO file"

4. REQUEST EXPLANATIONS: Ask Claude Code to explain decisions
   - "Why did you choose this HTML structure?"
   - "Explain the accessibility considerations in this code"

5. ASK FOR ALTERNATIVES: Get different approaches
   - "Show me 3 different ways to implement the FAQ section"
   - "What are the pros and cons of using CSS Grid vs Flexbox here?"

6. INCREMENTAL BUILDS: Build page by page, section by section
   - Don't try to build all 5 pages at once
   - Start with one page, get it perfect, then move to next

7. TEST AS YOU GO: Request testing strategies
   - "How can I test this on different screen sizes?"
   - "What accessibility tools should I use to validate this?"

8. PERFORMANCE CHECKS: Ask for optimization
   - "How can I improve the page load speed?"
   - "Are there any performance bottlenecks in this code?"
