Supporting Federal Contractors & Government Projects
Content:
As a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise (DVBE), EHS Analytical Solutions is uniquely positioned to support prime contractors on federal military construction and California state projects.
Our SDVOSB certification helps federal prime contractors meet their small business subcontracting goals on USACE, NAVFAC, Air Force, Army, and VA construction projects. By partnering with us for Site Safety Health Officer (SSHO) services, industrial hygiene, and environmental support, contractors can satisfy SDVOSB participation requirements while receiving professional EHS services from a veteran-owned firm.
On California state projects, our DVBE certification helps contractors meet their disabled veteran business participation goals on Caltrans and other public works contracts. This is particularly valuable for contractors bidding Caltrans highway projects requiring Lead Compliance Plans and safety services.
Our veteran leadership brings firsthand military experience (USMC & U.S. Navy), enabling us to work effectively on active military installations and understand the unique requirements of federal construction projects. We're not just meeting certification requirements - we're veteran business owners who understand the mission and are committed to excellence.
