═══ MAIN CONTENT SECTION 1: What is a Lead Compliance Plan ═══
H2 Heading:
What is a Lead Compliance Plan?
Content:
A Lead Compliance Plan (LCP) is a comprehensive safety document required by Cal/OSHA Title 8, Section 1532.1 for construction projects where workers may be exposed to lead-containing materials. The plan outlines how contractors will identify, control, monitor, and protect workers from lead exposure during construction activities.
Lead Compliance Plans are particularly important on:
	•	• Caltrans highway and bridge projects (common requirement in contract specifications)
	•	• Bridge painting, rehabilitation, and demolition projects
	•	• Renovation of older structures with lead-based paint
	•	• Soil remediation projects in areas with lead contamination
	•	• Any construction activity disturbing lead-containing materials
═══ MAIN CONTENT SECTION 2: When Required ═══
H2 Heading:
When is a Lead Compliance Plan Required?
Content:
Cal/OSHA Requirements:
Under Cal/OSHA Title 8, Section 1532.1, a Lead Compliance Plan is required when:
	•	• Employee exposure to lead is expected to exceed the Action Level (30 µg/m³ as an 8-hour TWA)
	•	• Tasks involve activities listed in Cal/OSHA Subsection 1532.1(d)(2) that trigger presumed exposure
	•	• Work involves manual demolition, abrasive blasting, cutting, grinding, or welding lead-containing materials
Caltrans Projects:
Most Caltrans highway and bridge projects involving structures built before 1978 include Lead Compliance Plan requirements in the contract specifications (typically found in Special Provisions). Contractors are responsible for developing the plan and submitting it for Caltrans approval before work begins.
