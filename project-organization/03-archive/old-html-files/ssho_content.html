<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About SSHO Services</h2>

<p><strong>Q: What is an SSHO?</strong><br>
A: A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) is a qualified safety professional who serves as the contractor's primary safety representative on federal construction projects.

<p><strong>Q: When is an SSHO required?</strong><br>
A: USACE, NAVFAC, and most federal construction contracts require a dedicated SSHO when the contract value exceeds $5 million or when the contracting officer determines project hazards warrant it. Review your contract's Section 01 35 26 for specific SSHO requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What qualifications does your SSHO staff have?</strong><br>
A: Our SSHO team includes Certified Industrial Hygienists (CIH), Certified Safety Professionals (CSP), and Construction Health and Safety Technicians (CHST).
