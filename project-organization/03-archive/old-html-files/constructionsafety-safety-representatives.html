    <!-- What is Safety Rep -->
    <section>
        <div class="container content-width">
            <h2>What Does a Safety Representative Do?</h2>
            <p>
                A safety representative (also called a safety officer, safety coordinator, or site safety manager) is a dedicated safety professional assigned to a construction project to ensure worker safety, maintain regulatory compliance, and implement the project's safety program. Safety representatives conduct daily jobsite inspections, identify and correct hazards, facilitate safety meetings, provide safety training, investigate incidents, coordinate with regulatory agencies, and serve as the primary safety resource for project management and workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many construction projects require or benefit from dedicated safety representation, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Large construction projects with multiple trades and contractors</li>
                <li>High-hazard work including confined spaces, fall hazards, or hazardous materials</li>
                <li>Projects requiring frequent regulatory inspections</li>
                <li>Companies without dedicated internal safety staff</li>
                <li>Projects in California requiring Cal-OSHA compliance expertise</li>
                <li>Caltrans projects requiring safety representative services</li>
                <li>Federal projects (when not requiring a formal SSHO)</li>
                <li>Multi-site construction operations needing safety coordination</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our safety representatives bring professional expertise, regulatory knowledge, and construction experience to ensure your project maintains the highest safety standards from groundbreaking through project completion.

            <h2 class="text-center">Safety Representative Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How is a safety representative different from an SSHO?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) is specifically required on federal construction projects over $5 million and must meet EM 385-1-1 qualifications. A safety representative is a more general term for on-site safety professionals on any construction project (private, state, or federal). While SSHOs follow strict EM 385-1-1 protocols, safety representatives can be tailored more flexibly to project-specific needs. Many Caltrans projects require safety representatives per Section 5-1.28, which is different from federal SSHO requirements.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Do we need a full-time safety representative or can we use part-time coverage?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">This depends on project size, complexity, and hazards. Large projects with multiple contractors, significant hazards, or regulatory requirements typically need full-time coverage. Smaller projects, lower-hazard work, or projects with strong internal safety culture may function well with part-time coverage (2-3 days per week). We can help assess your project and recommend appropriate coverage levels.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Can your safety representative enforce our company's safety rules?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Yes. Our safety representatives implement and enforce your company's safety policies, rules, and procedures. They have stop-work authority for imminent hazards and can direct workers to correct unsafe conditions. However, they work as an extension of your project management team—they don't replace your supervisors' authority but rather support them in maintaining safety standards.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What if our safety representative and our project manager disagree on a safety issue?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Our safety representatives work collaboratively with project management, not adversarially. Most issues are resolved through professional discussion of hazards, regulations, and practical solutions. However, our safety reps have a professional obligation to raise legitimate safety concerns. In rare cases of unresolved disagreements, we escalate to senior management (yours and ours) for resolution. Our goal is always to find practical solutions that protect workers while keeping the project moving.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How quickly can you provide a safety representative?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">For California projects, we typically mobilize safety representatives within 3-5 business days. For projects requiring specific certifications, clearances, or out-of-state travel, mobilization may take 1-2 weeks. For bid support or project planning, we can provide safety representative resumes and qualifications within 24-48 hours.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What's included in safety representative pricing?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Our safety representative services are typically priced as hourly or daily rates (for part-time coverage) or monthly rates (for full-time dedicated coverage). Pricing includes the safety rep's on-site time, documentation and reporting, safety meeting facilitation, training coordination, and reasonable travel within the local area. Additional costs may include specialized training delivery, equipment purchases, or extensive out-of-area travel. We provide transparent, detailed quotes.</div>
