<!-- Why Partner -->
<h2>Why Federal Prime Contractors Choose EHS Analytical Solutions</h2>
<p>As a federal prime contractor, you need reliable SDVOSB partners who understand military construction requirements
    and deliver quality results. Here's what makes us different:</p>

<h3>Meet Your SDVOSB Goals</h3>

    working on active military installations. Our Certified Industrial Hygienists (CIH) and Certified Safety
    Professionals (CSP) have extensive experience supporting federal construction projects across the country.</p>

<h3>Veteran Leadership</h3>
<p>Our company is owned and operated by disabled veterans (USMC & U.S. Navy) who understand military culture and the
    importance of mission success. We're not just checking a box - we're fellow veterans committed to supporting the
    contractors who build America's military infrastructure.</p>
